0,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Steve,"This is awesome! Can we hope/expect that Microsoft will never again put non-standard stuff in the browser to maintain for years to come? E.g. No ActiveX, no XML Data Islands, no VML, no behaviours, no modal dialogs, no VBScript, no createPopup type crud ever again? We need to be sure that Microsoft has learned it's lesson and will strive to follow standards, not try to invent their own and attempt to strong arm the other browsers to follow suit. "
1,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Gus,"@Steve ‚Äì come on now, that is unfair, as ALL browser have always had their own slant on things, since day 1!!! IE5.5 was a revelation‚Ä¶ XMLHttp requests which are now called AJAX and ubiquitous. IE6 was an amazing browser at the time hence why it lasted so long. Chrome, FF all have their own version of HTML5 and CSS3. I agree everything should be standardised but remember many of the innovations actually came from breaking the rules and end up being W3C recommendations etc.  "
2,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Fastidious,"@Gus, I do not see it as unfair. I do not believe Chrome and FF have ""their own version of HTML5 and CSS3,"" but we are not talking about them, we are talking about what Spartan will become. @Steve has a point: do not repeat the same mistakes, or it will fail again. "
3,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Smorgasbord,> IE6 was an amazing browser at the time hence why it lasted so long. That's laughable ‚Äì it lasted because it was just around on old computers. 
4,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Fastidious,"@Gus, IE 6 *was not* an amazing browser. It was, like each IE, a browser bundled with Windows. It lasted that long because it took Microsoft that long to come up with something else, and companies invested much building applications on its proprietary architecture. It was, and is, a horrible browser. "
5,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Yannick,"@Smorgasbord and @Fastidious ‚Äì Yeah‚Ä¶ no. That's not the reason. Internet Explorer 6 had only one competitor back in its days, and that was Netscape, and they just messed up. Netscape 6 was a piece of software the worls should never have seen. Internet Explorer 6 was a great browser for its time, and introduced an aweful lot of ideas we now call HTML5 and CSS3. Either way, keep up the good work! A question through: is Edge (or Spartan) coming to Windows 8.1, 7, Server 2008 R2, 2012 and 012 R2 7 for the people that don't/can't upgrade to Windows 10? "
6,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Rob Cannon,"I think this is great work and a great plan. ¬†BUT, I think if Microsoft is serious about supporting the evergreen browser, then Spartan needs to run on Windows 7, also. ¬†While the Windows 10 upgrade will be free to consumers, many won't upgrade. ¬†Businesses will be slower to upgrade, so that means it will be years before older versions of IE are no longer used. ¬†Having Spartan on Windows 7 would really help spur the change to evergreen browsers for everyone. "
7,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Jon,"@Fastidious @Smorgasbord Wrong, wrong, wrong. Were you guys actually around and doing web development in 2001, when IE6 was released? The only major, competing browser was Netscape 4. Try downloading Netscape 4 and comparing the two. Mozilla 1.0 wasn't released until 2002, and Firefox 1.0 wasn't released until 2004. IE6 was by *far* the best freely-available browser that had ever been made *at that time*. Possibly Opera was better, but it still required payment back then, and Opera 7, with the Presto layout engine, wasn't released until 2003. In any case, IE6 was a huge leap forward in terms of stability and standards compliance. Of course, by modern standards it is a buggy piece of ***, but that was absolutely not the perception of the majority of developers and users in 2001. Saying otherwise is attempting to rewrite history. Furthermore, discussion of standards compliance misses the point that what passed as ""standards"" in the IE6 era were woefully incomplete. It was impossible to read the HTML and CSS specs and produce a interoperable implementation of either, because many topics around things like parsing and error handling were not covered, not covered in sufficient detail, or did not match the reality of what existing browsers did (and what web sites *relied* on them doing). It has taken many years of effort by the WHATWG, W3C and other groups to produce specifications and test suites detailed and accurate enough that it is possible to make browsers that meaningfully standards compliant and interoperable.

10,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Brian LePore,"@Fastidious, The growing list of sites that are Chrome-specific has definitely shown me that they have their own version of HTML5 and CSS3. Heck, when Google Inbox first launched it only worked in Chrome. You were rejected if you tried to log in with Firefox. In regards to IE6, it was a very good browser for its time. But it did have bugs that needed to be patched that just went unpatched for years because IE had no true competition and the development team was basically shut down and members moved to other projects. I believe they just addressed security issues for a number of years. "
11,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Brian,"Death to IE forever. ¬†You guys should have done this sh!t long ago. ¬†How many hours have developers had to spend getting around incredibly frustrating IE crap? ¬†Don't act like starting fresh will erase your past transgressions, Microsoft. The developer community may eventually embrace you, but your sh!tty browsers from the past won't soon be forgotten, even if your new browser is better than Chrome, FF, and Safari combined. You should just stop making browsers all-together; seriously. "
12,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,jason patrick hall,"A concept Microsoft will initialize is project Spartan, into windows 10 devices, such as phones, tablets, PC's (and beyond). I have used Microsoft internet explorer and network navigator for twenty years now, its a pleasant feeling Microsoft has been transitioning their browser subsystems like JavaScript to splitting-GPU into faster processing speeds, as well as my personal favorite 2 & 3 Dimensional graphics ending competition while providing definitive sources for expansion and innovative technology. By transitioning IE with an ambitious (or determined) goal of ""do not Break the web"" in mind, we have to remember the web consist of roughly fourty-four billion different websites. So it was a smart move to focus testing on nine-thousand of the most impactful sites around the globe. This will put us ahead of our competitors. When initializing upgraded software like IE will bring some technicalities, maybe people with smaller privately owned sites and engines might not be able to access customer support or contact with another user online. But we as people have to (for generations to come) make significant advances to stay ahead and provide meaningful progress. It's tough when dealing with statistics in an annual report for instance, or translating economic into technology. You've got to figure or predict a point where supply meets demand, scientifically, not an easy target. Rethinking pros & cons or comparing and contrasting differences that might arise between legacy & modern might have glitches, something I'm unaware if Microsoft has room for. In the report it states significant rethinking came forth about the enterprise web applications, so it becomes a question of just how compatible this browser should become, by troubleshooting and repairing older perhaps reliable accounts might have an adverse ""breaking effect"" on the regular IE users. So it becomes a technical throwback question of business ethics, morals, & conditions. Might take some brainstorming. The CV compatibility viewing list would allow a number of ""broken"" legacy sites to be fixed and able to use. The X-UA-compatible version where users used older document programs as a stopgap, meaning they are avid user of IE while sticking to what worked for them in the past as well could be considered an investment or a smarter means of using Spartan or windows 10. This would be a time to focus on pie charts, percentages, averages, division which encompasses real-world remainders. Faced with the challenge of making IE a positive or optimistic experience for its users, ideally your faced with integrating tools and task-management, basically an infrastructure used in the past and adding a definitive newer concept that will also have its own need to stay with the times in the future. So by bringing a web browser that meets our current needs as well as incorporating older technology while staying true to our investors and counterparts. It's pretty safe to say Microsoft has held on to its values and mission statement. "
13,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,nobody,Netscape 4.x was pretty bad but a lot of us held onto it for a long time while we waited for Mozilla to get its act together. On Windows Mozilla was not very usable as I recall until Firefox. However a lot of us using Linux tried various forks designed to get Gecko in shape. In 2001 or 2002 I was using galeon which was gecko with gnome/gtk+. Then phoenix came along and then it was renamed to Firefox and I used it a lot before it hit 1.0. But I don't think it was common to do that on Windows.

16,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Yannick,"@Pragmatic engineer ‚Äì Because f*ck web standards, right? Webkit is becoming a terrible engine, and it should be clear to everybody that Apple has no intention improving it, unless it fits their agenda. And Blink isn't any better. Not every browser should be using the same rendering engine, because that would throw us back 15 years where 1 way of doing something is the only way. Remember, the IE monopoly? Well, now we have a Webkit monopoly, and it gives us the same result: crappy websites that follow Webkit-standards instead of web standards. "
17,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Rinse and Repeat,"So they forked it and then worked backwards to remove their existing features‚Ä¶ doesn't sound like they're doing anything new to me.

18,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Same Old MS,"""A community effort"" Until you open source your rendering engine and let users submit bugs and patches, EdgeHTML will not be ""A community effort"". Take a look at other leading rendering engines like WebKit, Blink, Gecko and more. They all are open source and they all support web standards faster than MS! Also, even if Windows 10 is going to be free for 7 & 8.1, some users may not want to switch. Spartan/EdgeHTML needs to be on Windows 7!!! You really expect people to UPDATE their entire OS, a risky operation just for a new web browser? Windows 10 is not a service pack, its a entire new OS that changes the UI and introduces driver and application incompatibility. "

22,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Ivan Privaci,"It seems like Microsoft is finally becoming IBM (in a good way, i.e. a ""mature"" company more willing to work with standards) while Apple is the one now busy trying to become Microsoft (abusively proprietary). It's far from the only bit of standard interoperability to be addressed, but there's just one that I personally will be watching for as an indication of how much better Microsoft is getting at Playing Well With Others: Give me .opus files in <audio> tags working on Microsoft's browser(s). (ideally, also .ogg [vorbis] for legacy purposes, and possibly even .flac for locally-stored data or fast streams, but .opus alone would be great all by itself). I saw Microsoft was adding support for the Microsoft superset(?) of WebRTC already, just add a parser for OGG containers and effectively 90% of the web (i.e. everyone but Apple Safari) will have a standard high-quality audio format to use.

26,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Bruce Williams,"@Eli re: ""multi-threaded touch input"", on the chance that you weren't joking, I'm pretty sure this means that the touch input, and perhaps some simple actions like scrolling, are driven on a different thread than the render thread, or the javascript thread, or something. The result is that each of those things (input/render/javascript/whatever) can hiccup or block, but the rest can continue and hopefully maintain the appearance of responsiveness. "
27,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,arizdev,"I am beginning to contribute to WebKit, it is not a terrible engine by any standard, however there are a lot of politics.

Regarding older browsers, at our company we are already at IE9 base support, as soon as that's over, we will be skipping IE10 to IE11, where I will rejoice. ¬†Three years from now, we will probably be only supporting browsers released in the last 18 months.

33,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Xavier,"Mozillian, all of Mozilla's projects are irrelevant today, including Firefox. Look at these recent browser usage stats: caniuse.com/usage_table.php As of January of this year, Firefox on the Desktop only has around 10% of the market. Firefox on Android has a whopping 0.13%! Firefox on iOS doesn't even exist! Chrome for Android alone has just about as many users as Firefox does on all platforms and for all versions! IE 11 alone almost has more users than Firefox has in total! Firefox is pretty much a dead project at this point. People are leaving it for browsers that actually work.

While I understand why the Spartan browser itself is a Windows 10 exclusive, since it uses all kinds of Windows 10 specific features.  However, the EdgeHTML engine does not need to be a Windows 10 exclusive. To really move the web forward, you need EdgeHTML on Windows 7. The best thing would probably be to just reuse the IE11 UI, and just import the engine switching from Windows 10, so that it can use both MSHTML and EdgeHTML. "

It means Microsoft themselves, also need to fix their own applications too, as oposed to just tellign us end users, as a bandaid, to '‚Ä¶just run it in Enterprise or Edge mode' versus, them fixing their apps/platforms to run in the newest standards compliant browser, or telling clients they need to overhaul and upgrade their entire infrastructure.  I hope Microsoft do not forget their own backyard, when it comes to compatibility testing with their future browsers. For example, many large corporations are still using SharePoint 2007. SharePoint 2007 only fully works in IE 7-9, because of it's heavy reliance on Active X. SharePoint 2007 will not run in 'Edge' mode in IE11, only in 'Enterprise'(backward compatible) mode. SharePoint 2013/Online requires a modern standards browser or 'Edge' mode in IE11, for HTML5 rendering, however, it still has some functionaility that requires Active X, which means it can still only fully function using IE only. This means corporations still have to support legacy applications and still have modern standards browsers. It is a daunting task from a development standpoint when we as 'citizen developers' are left to develop for multiple Microsoft software/plaforms and use only one corporately accepted browser. Corporations are then telling us developers to make our applications browser agnostic, it becomes very difficult when debating the pros/cons of doing so, to the upper management with no real understanding of the underlying rendering engine nuances, and Microsoft's various software reliances on other Microsoft technologies (IE (modes), Active X, OS browser restrictions, version of Microsoft Office, Microsoft's slow implementaiton of Web Standards (HTML5, CSS3, ECMCA 5 and 6, proprietary extensions/APIs, etc).

My own website, I was pretty frustrated to find that Chrome still doesn't support the ""animation"" CSS attribute. They let you specify it with prefixes, but Microsoft has detailed a pretty good case as to why all web developers need to stop using those. "

75,A break from the past the birth of microsofts new web rendering engine,Eli the Developer,"The Best thing IE team can do is pay each developer that struggled countless hours to make things (halfway) working, The management didn't change, the old stubborn attitude didn't change either, Microsoft is like the ""chains"" that hold on to a f22 with full engine thrust and not letting it take off.. (the web is the f22)  Look at status.modern.ie and you will see tons of things ""under consideration"". what consideration?? ¬†while each browser is way ahead you are still considering?? Just close your shop and stop making browsers!!! "
