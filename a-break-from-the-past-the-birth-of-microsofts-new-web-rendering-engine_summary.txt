Internet Explorer has been the Microsoft Web browser for 20 years and has evolved to work with ever-changing Web sites over that time.And yet, even as we released new and improved versions of IE, we heard complaints about some sites being broken in IE – from family members, co-workers in other parts of Microsoft, or online discussions.As we examined these sites, they were often not on our top 9000 list.In Windows 10 planning, we set out to tackle this apparent discrepancy – how could our real-world compatibility be declining when our compatibility testing data shows that we are improving?Standards focus.We needed a plan to make it easy for Web developers to build compatible sites regardless of which browser they develop first for.A clean break also necessitates a new user-agent string to ensure that no IE-specific code was being sent.This built upon a long browser history of using whatever tokens are necessary to get the desired content from servers.To do so, we do daily analysis on trillions of URLs crawled in conjunction with Bing to detect patterns that exist in the head of the Web and the tail of the Web.In addition, we revised our internal engineering processes to prioritize real-world interoperability issues uncovered by our data analysis.For users that upgrade to Windows 10, the engine will be evergreen, meaning that it will be kept current with Windows 10 as a service.That’s why the Project Spartan journey has included a number of ways for you to get involved.Check out our Web platform roadmap at status.modern.ie.For help on more detailed issues, ask a question on our StackOverflow page.
